# File Summary

## Purpose
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

## File Format
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A header with the file path (## File: path/to/file)
  b. The full contents of the file in a code block

## Usage Guidelines
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

## Notes
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's
  configuration.
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to
  the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including
  binary files.

You are a helpful assistant that aids with processing real-estate property owner company information and retrieving 
geocoded location data. 

Your task is to assist users in obtaining accurate and relevant information about real-estate properties, 
including their addresses, geocoded locations, and other related details. 

You should be able to handle various types of requests, such as cleaning addresses, geocoding locations, 
and extracting domains from URLs.

You should also be able to handle cases where the information is not available or needs to be inferred from
the provided data.

You should be able to handle the following types of requests:

1. **Clean Address**: Given a raw address, clean it up to a standard format.
2. **Geocode Location**: Given a cleaned address, retrieve the geocoded location data.
3. **Extract Domain**: Given a URL, extract the domain name.
4. **Get Property Owner Company Information**: Given a property address, retrieve the owner company information.
5. **Get Property Owner Company Geocoded Location**: Given a property address, retrieve the owner company geocoded location.
6. **Get Property Owner Company Domain**: Given a property address, retrieve the owner company domain.
7. **Get Property Owner Company Address**: Given a property address, retrieve the owner company address.

#' @param email A character string representing the email address to validate.
#' @param domain A character string representing the domain to validate.
#' @param timeout An integer representing the timeout in seconds for DNS queries.
#'
#' @returns
#' - `validate_email_regex()`: Returns `TRUE` if the email address is valid according to the regex pattern, otherwise `FALSE`.
#' - `validate_email_mx()`: Returns `TRUE` if the email address has valid MX records or A records, otherwise `FALSE`.

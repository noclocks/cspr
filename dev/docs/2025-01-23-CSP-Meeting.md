## Meeting Analysis

### Overview 

Key Highlights from Meeting on AI Integration Strategies
During the meeting, various strategies for leveraging AI and data scraping were discussed to enhance property acquisition and management. The focus was on utilizing AI to handle large datasets for market opportunities and automating outreach and analysis processes.

Attendees: Patrick Howard, Jason Pollack, Frank Dellaglio
Additional stakeholders mentioned include Jeff and Jimmy.
Primary Goals:
Develop AI strategies for identifying undervalued or off-market property deals.
Implement AI for scraping contact info and market data analysis.
Challenges:
Limited email contacts in the current database of 2,700 properties.
Only 1% expected response rate from initial outreach efforts.
Potential AI Applications:
Scraping data from multiple sources to fill gaps in current datasets.
Creating a sophisticated AI tool for market analysis and decision-making.
Step 1: Scraping and completing contact information database.
Step 2: Utilizing AI for detailed property and market analysis.
Begin with testing a few properties for feasibility assessments.

### Next Steps

Patrick to send an NDA and proposal. Initiate basic data scraping for contact information. Discuss AI implementation with partner Jimmy to define detailed deliverables.

### Concerns and Considerations

Emphasis on maintaining confidentiality and ensuring secure data handling. Explore possible membership or additional resources (e.g., NMHC) for data access.
